For this Assignment I completed the first three parts completely and I think I finsihed rest two in part.
I have successfully created airport and historical weather data through file manipulation and web crawling.
For the fourth question I was confused if it asked for ever possible pairs are to be investigated or not. This is massive computing and 
so I looked into seven days and did the correlation for every city pair. 
Also I did the same for the lattitude change and longitude change and cloud cover and high temperature change.

Please look at the attached files airport.txt anf weatherdata.txt for the data collected which I believe are correct.
